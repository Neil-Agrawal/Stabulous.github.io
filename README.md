# Stabulous
An intelligent program that stabilizes your blurry and shaky video by dissecting, assessing, and improving each frame to produce the best video possible. 

## Why?
The current methods of stablizing video use cropping or black bars which excludes parts of the frames and takes away from the user experience. We wanted to fix this using generative adversarial networks.
